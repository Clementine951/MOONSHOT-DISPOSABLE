# Executive Summary

**Disposable** is a mobile application designed to bring back the charm of traditional disposable cameras, adapted for today’s digital world. Built natively for iOS with Swift and Firebase, the app enables users to create or join event-specific photo albums where each participant has a limited number of photos—just like with real disposable cameras.

The app solves a common modern problem: at group events, photos are scattered across dozens of phones and messaging apps. Disposable offers a clean, unified experience where everyone contributes to the same album. The photos can be viewed immediately or remain hidden until the end of the event for a surprise reveal.

The project includes a full iOS application and a lightweight **App Clip**, allowing guests to participate instantly by scanning a QR code—no download required. This makes it perfect for high-energy events like weddings, parties, festivals, and bar nights where frictionless interaction is key.

**Vision:** To become the go-to event photo-sharing app that balances simplicity, nostalgia, and social connection.

**Status:**  
- ✅ Launched on the App Store  
- ✅ App Clip fully functional  
- 🚀 Roadmap includes a native Android version, App Clip camera integration, and premium event features  

**Target Market:** Event organisers, wedding planners, party hosts, and casual users seeking a fun, low-effort way to collect memories.

**Business Model:** Currently free, with plans to introduce monetisation through pay-per-event upgrades, premium customisation, and future partnerships.

**Founder:** Clémentine Curel, a full-stack developer with a passion for intuitive digital experiences and a strong technical foundation in mobile and cloud development.

# Problem Statement

In social events like weddings, birthday parties, festivals, and casual bar nights, photos are a vital part of the experience. However, the way these memories are captured and shared today is fragmented and chaotic:

- Photos are scattered across dozens of phones  
- Guests forget to share what they took  
- Hosts struggle to gather everything afterward  
- Spontaneity is lost in curated Instagram posts or group chats  
- Not everyone wants to be on social media

There is no simple, automatic way to gather and showcase **everyone’s photos in one place**—without asking guests to upload files or download complex apps.

At the same time, there’s a growing nostalgia for analog photography: the fun of limited shots, the excitement of delayed reveals, and the shared joy of flipping through physical prints or albums.

**Disposable** solves both.


# The Solution

**Disposable** is a mobile-first photo-sharing experience that revives the charm of disposable cameras—digitally. It offers a fun, unified, and low-friction way for people to contribute photos to a single shared album during an event.

Guests can join an event by scanning a QR code, taking pictures with a limited number of shots, and sharing them directly within the app or App Clip. The host chooses whether the photos are visible immediately or only revealed at the end—preserving the surprise and excitement of classic film rolls.

## Key Features:
- 📸 **Digital Disposable Camera**  
  Each participant gets a limited number of shots to capture the moment mindfully, just like using a real disposable.

- ⚡ **Instant Join via App Clip**  
  Guests join the event instantly—no installation required—making it perfect for spontaneous environments like festivals or bar events.

- 🌐 **Automatic Event Website**  
  A unique webpage is generated for each event, displaying all shared photos in one beautifully organised gallery.  
  → Great for sharing with guests after the event or printing photos later.

- 🔒 **Private & Social-Free**  
  No public feeds, no social media logins. Just one private album, shared only with the people who were there.

- 🎯 **Designed for Events**  
  Tailored for weddings, parties, festivals, and group outings. Lightweight and intuitive, even for non-tech-savvy guests.

By combining the best of nostalgic photography with the ease of mobile tech, Disposable makes photo-sharing fun again—while solving the messy problems of event photo collection.

*Note: These tiers are still under exploration and will be refined through user testing.*


## 🧩 Monetisation Philosophy

- Keep the experience simple, inclusive, and fun for all users  
- Monetise **organisers and power users**, not guests  
- Build trust before monetising—users should feel value before being asked to pay  
- Align pricing with event value, not volume

# Go-to-Market Strategy

Disposable’s initial strategy focuses on **grassroots growth**, **event-specific virality**, and **word-of-mouth marketing**. The goal is to grow organically through real-life use cases while building credibility and visibility with minimal marketing spend.


## 🎯 Target Segments (Early Focus)

1. **Couples & Wedding Planners**  
   - Offer Disposable as a modern guestbook alternative  
   - Promote via online wedding forums, social media groups, and bridal fairs  

2. **Festival & Event Attendees**  
   - Leverage App Clip to reduce friction—no app installation needed  
   - Create QR-code-ready kits for smaller event organisers and indie festivals  

3. **Bars, DJs, and Local Venues**  
   - Encourage venues to offer Disposable at themed nights or community events  
   - Provide value by offering them a shared photo album they can repost  

4. **Family Gatherings & Travel Groups**
   - Target family events, reunions, and group trips  
   - Create a “family album” feature to encourage sharing among relatives

## 🚀 Launch Channels

- **QR Code Flyers & Posters**  
  Custom QR codes for events make it easy to join instantly—perfect for physical venues, weddings, or invites.

- **Social Media Campaigns**  
  Share real event galleries (with consent), feature nostalgic design, and highlight the “reveal at the end” twist.  
  Focus platforms: Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest (especially for weddings).

- **Website & SEO**  
  Optimise [www.disposableapp.xyz](https://www.disposableapp.xyz) for event-related keywords like:  
  _"photo app for wedding guests"_, _"shared album festival"_, _"no install camera app"_

- **App Store Optimisation (ASO)**  
  Improve visibility via keywords, screenshots, and feature descriptions focused on:
  - "event photo app"
  - "disposable camera app"
  - "wedding guest photo sharing"

## 👥 Word-of-Mouth Triggers

- **"What’s that QR code?"**: Every event using Disposable turns into a mini marketing opportunity
- **Event guests = potential hosts**: After seeing it in action, participants are likely to reuse it for their own events
- **Automatic web gallery**: Shareable and beautiful, encouraging hosts to send the link post-event  

## 🧪 Early Growth Tactics

- Run **pilot events** with friends, family, and test users to build case studies
- Ask for **event photos and testimonials** to showcase real use
- Offer early adopters **free paid event upgrades** in exchange for feedback and visibility



# Technology Overview

Disposable is a **native iOS application**, developed entirely in **Swift using SwiftUI** for modern, responsive interfaces. It integrates with **Firebase** for backend services, and uses cutting-edge Apple technologies to enable **App Clip** onboarding without installation.

## 📱 Architecture Highlights

- **Swift + SwiftUI**  
  Clean, modern codebase with a strong foundation for animations, responsiveness, and iOS-native design.

- **Firebase Integration**  
  - Firestore for event, participant, and image metadata  
  - Firebase Storage for storing and retrieving photos  
  - REST API used for App Clip (due to App Clip limitations)

- **App Clip**  
  - Fully functional App Clip using universal links and QR codes  
  - Participants can view and upload photos instantly, without downloading the full app

- **Automatic Web Gallery Generator**  
  - Photos shared within an event are published to a private gallery website  
  - Automatically generated via cloud logic (static and dynamic gallery options for future versions)

- **Scalability Considerations**  
  - Event-based structure supports parallel usage (multiple events at once)  
  - Backend can be extended to support admin dashboards, advanced analytics, and more via Firebase rules and optional server logic

## 📲 Android Version  
An Android version is not yet available but is planned for a future release. Development will likely use **Kotlin + Jetpack Compose** or a **React Native cross-platform** version to reduce duplication.

# Competition Analysis

The photo-sharing space is saturated—but Disposable stands out by targeting a **very specific user behavior**: capturing group memories at events, with simplicity and surprise.

| App | Description | Weaknesses |
|-----|-------------|------------|
| **Instagram / Snapchat** | Social platforms with stories, posts, albums | Too public, curated, lacks event control |
| **Google Photos Shared Albums** | Lets users upload into shared folders | Requires Google account, not fun or limited |
| **Eversnap / WedShoots** | Apps for wedding photo sharing | Outdated UI, requires full app install, limited traction |
| **AirDrop / WhatsApp / Telegram** | Common tools to send photos | Manual, chaotic, hard to centralise or download later |
| **Poparazzi** | Social app where friends post for you | Not event-specific, not private, App Clip not supported |

### 🔑 Disposable's Competitive Edge

- ✅ **Join with a QR code – no install needed**  
- ✅ **Limited photos per person → encourages mindful, fun shooting**  
- ✅ **Reveal-later mode mimics the surprise of analog cameras**  
- ✅ **Automatically generated gallery website for sharing memories**  
- ✅ **Focused on events, not social feeds**  
- ✅ **Built with modern iOS tech stack and strong UX**
