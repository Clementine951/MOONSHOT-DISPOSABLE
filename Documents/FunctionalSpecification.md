## Project Overview

The Disposable Camera application aims to provide users with a nostalgic and communal experience of capturing and sharing moments at events. Inspired by traditional disposable cameras, the app offers a user-friendly interface that allows participants to take photos, share them with others, and create lasting memories.

Participants can access the app through an App Clip, which allows them to join events and participate without downloading the full app. Each event has its own gallery where photos are automatically shared with all attendees, fostering a communal experience. Initially designed for iOS, the app is intended to be cross-platform compatible in future iterations.

## Project Definition

### Vision

The vision for the Disposable Camera application is to create a user-friendly mobile app that facilitates the capturing and sharing of memorable moments during events. By leveraging the nostalgic appeal of disposable cameras and combining it with modern technology, the app enhances event experiences, fostering greater interaction among attendees.

The app is designed to be intuitive and accessible, catering to users of all ages, with a particular focus on simplifying the user experience for older individuals. By enabling access through an App Clip and limiting the number of photos each participant can take, the app encourages users to be more present and engaged during events.

### Objectives

1. **Enhance Accessibility**: Ensure the app is intuitive and user-friendly, making it accessible to users of all ages.
2. **Seamless Access**: Utilize App Clips to allow participants to join events and share photos without needing to download the full app.
3. **Foster Engagement**: Limit photo-taking to encourage mindfulness and selective capturing of moments.
4. **Facilitate Instant Sharing**: Automatically share photos in a communal event gallery.
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Start with iOS and expand to other platforms in future iterations.
6. **Promote Inclusivity**: Create an inclusive app that fosters meaningful connections among attendees.
7. **Enhance Event Experience**: Combine modern technology with nostalgic elements to enrich event experiences.
