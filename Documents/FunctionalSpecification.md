### Ubiquitous Requirements

Ubiquitous functional requirements are always active. They are not invoked by an event or input, nor are they limited to a subset of the system‚Äôs operating states.

Template:   The shall .

Example:     The control system shall prevent engine over speed.

### State-driven Requirements

State-driven functional requirements are active throughout the time a defined state remains true. In Mavis EARS method, state-driven requirements are identified with the keyword WHILE.

Template:   WHILE the shall .

Example:     While the aircraft is in-flight and the engine is running, the control system shall maintain engine fuel flow above ?? lbs/sec.

### Event-driven Requirements

Event-driven functional requirements require a response only when an event is detected at the system boundary. In other words, they are triggered by a specific event. The EARS method identifies event-driven requirements with the keyword WHEN.

Template:   WHEN the shall .

Example:     When continuous ignition is commanded by the aircraft, the control system shall switch on continuous ignition.

### Unwanted Behaviour Requirements

Unwanted behaviour functional requirements cover all undesirable situations. Good systems engineering (SE) practice anticipates undesirable situations and imposes requirements to mitigate them.

Unwanted behaviour requirements are often imposed when the system must respond to a trigger under less than optimum conditions. The EARS method uses the keyword combination IF/THEN to identify requirements aimed at mitigating unwanted behaviour.

Template:   IF, THEN the shall.

Example:     If the computed airspeed is unavailable, then the control system shall use the modelled airspeed.

### Complex Requirements

Often, a specific set of one or more preconditions (states or optional features) must be present before the occurrence a specific event for that event to trigger a required system response. In such cases, the EARS templates may be combined, using a combination of the keywords.

Complex requirements can be composed for desired behaviour or for unwanted behaviour. The EARS method provides a template for each.

Template:   (Desired behaviour) Where, while , when the shall .

Template:   (Unwanted behaviour) Where, while , if then the shall .

Example:     While the aircraft is on the ground, when reverse thrust is commanded, the control system shall enable deployment of the thrust reverser.

## User Cases

weeding, party, vacation, baptism, anniversary

Baptism: grandma / grandchild -> the mom put the disposable in place 
-> the grandma don't really know how to take good photos, don't have the money for a photograph 
allow the participant to 

Christmas

Weeding -> enhance the engagement of the invitees

Anniversary

Party 

an elder at a baptism  70s
-> the grandma 70s

a family for christmas Alls
-> the mom 50s

a couple for their weeding 30s 
-> the husband 30s

a child for an anniversary  12s
-> child's anniversary 11 to 12s 

group of friends for a party 20s
-> the one that always organise everything 21s


## User Journey Map

Discovery:

User receives an invitation to a friend's wedding, which mentions the use of a disposable camera app for capturing and sharing moments.
User searches for the app in the app store based on the provided information.
Onboarding:

User downloads and installs the app on their smartphone.
Upon opening the app, the user is prompted to create an account or log in as a guest.
Event Entry:

On the day of the wedding, user arrives at the venue and sees a QR code displayed at the entrance.
User opens the app and scans the QR code to gain entry to the event.
Capturing Moments:

Throughout the wedding ceremony and reception, user uses the app's camera interface to capture candid moments, such as the bride walking down the aisle, guests mingling, and speeches.
User appreciates the simplicity of the camera settings, making it easy to adjust focus and exposure.
Sharing Photos:

After taking photos, user selects the ones they want to share and adds them to the event gallery within the app.
User enjoys seeing photos shared by other attendees and leaves comments on their favourites.
Managing Gallery:

User reviews the photos shared in the event gallery and deletes any duplicates or unwanted shots.
User saves their favourite photos to their device for safekeeping and future reminiscing.
Feedback and Support:

Upon returning home, user reflects on their experience with the app and appreciates its role in capturing special moments at the wedding.
User considers providing feedback to the app developers to suggest improvements or share their positive experience.
