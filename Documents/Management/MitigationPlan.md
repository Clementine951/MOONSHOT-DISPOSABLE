# Risks Management Mitigation Plan

This document serves as the Risk Mitigation Management Plan for the virtual processor project of team 1. Its purpose is to systematically identify, assess, and manage potential risks that may impact the success of the project. The plan outlines strategies for mitigating these risks and establishes a framework for ongoing risk monitoring and communication.

## **I. Risk Identification:**

## **II. Risk Mitigation Strategies:**

**Avoidance:** Change project plans to eliminate the risk.

**Reduction:** Take actions to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk.

**Transfer:** Shift the risk to a third party (e.g., through insurance or outsourcing).

**Acceptance:** Acknowledge the risk but decide not to take any action.

## **IV. Monitoring and Review:**

EXAMPLE

To ensure the ongoing effectiveness of our risk mitigation strategies, we will establish a regular review process. This process aims to assess the performance of the implemented strategies, identify any emerging risks, and make necessary adjustments to our risk management approach.

* **Regular Review Meetings:**
    * Conduct scheduled review meetings to evaluate the overall status of risk mitigation efforts.
* **Performance Assessment:**
    * Assess the effectiveness of each mitigation strategy in addressing identified risks.
    * Evaluate the impact of implemented strategies on risk likelihood and severity.
* **Lessons Learned:**
    * Encourage open discussions to capture lessons learned from past experiences and improve future risk mitigation strategies.
    * Document insights gained during the review process for continuous improvement.
* **Adjustment of Strategies:**
    * Based on the review findings, make necessary adjustments to existing mitigation strategies.
    * Introduce new strategies or modify existing ones to address evolving project risks.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

To objectively monitor the status of each risk and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies, we will define key performance indicators (KPIs). These KPIs will serve as measurable metrics to gauge progress and provide valuable insights into the risk landscape.

* **Risk Likelihood:**
    * Percentage reduction in the likelihood of identified risks.
* **Risk Severity:**
    * Measurement of the impact reduction on potential risks.
* **Resource Utilisation:**
    * Assessment of the resources allocated versus resources required for risk mitigation.

## **V. Contingency Plans:**

EXAMPLE
|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Technical Complexity** |     |
| **Trigger** | Involvement in complex programming tasks leading to project delays and increased likelihood of bugs. |
| **Activation Process** | **Notification:**<br><br>* The Software Engineer will notify the Tech Lead.<br><br> Or / And<br><br>* The Tech Lead will notify the team and stakeholders.<br><br> **Meeting:** A meeting will be scheduled within 24 hours to assess technical challenges and reevaluate project scope.<br><br>**Communication:** Establish a dedicated communication channel for updates on technical challenges. |
| **Roles & Responsibilities** | **Tech Lead:** Coordination of efforts to simplify technical requirements.<br><br>**Project Manager:** Prepare to notify the stakeholders.<br><br>**Other Team Members:** Actively participate in addressing technical challenges. |
| **Communication Protocol** | **Regular Updates:** Use of GitHub for consistent updates on technical challenges.<br><br>**Simplified Technical Requirements:** Reevaluate and simplify technical requirements where possible. |
