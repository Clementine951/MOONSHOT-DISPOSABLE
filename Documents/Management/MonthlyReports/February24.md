**Monthly Report: February 2024**

**Project Overview:**
Throughout February, my focus has been on the preliminary stages of the Disposable Camera App project. This initiative aims to develop a mobile application that replicates the experience of using disposable cameras, enabling users to capture and share candid moments with ease and nostalgia.

**Functional Tasks:**

1. **Mockups:**
   - Developed detailed mockups using Figma to visualise the user interface and experience of the Disposable Camera App.
   - Emphasised recreating the nostalgic ambience of disposable cameras while integrating contemporary mobile design principles.

2. **Features Breakdown:**
   - Identified crucial features necessary for the Disposable Camera App, including photo capture, event creation and QR code sharing.

3. **Flowcharts:**
   - Created flowcharts to delineate the functional processes within the app, encompassing photo capture, event creation, and photo sharing.
   - Clarified decision points and user interactions to streamline the user journey and enhance usability.

**Technical Tasks:**

1. **Language Research:**
   - Conducted research to determine the most suitable technologies for app development, considering factors like platform compatibility and ease of use.
   - Explored options such as React Native and Flutter for cross-platform development, with the goal of efficient code sharing and maintenance.

2. **App Functionality Investigation:**
   - Explored the technical feasibility of app functionalities such as QR code sharing and app clips.
   - Investigated APIs and third-party services for QR code generation to ensure seamless integration into the app.

**Challenges:**
   - Balancing the simplicity of disposable cameras with modern mobile app functionality to create an intuitive user experience.
   - Ensuring compatibility with a broad range of mobile devices and operating systems to maximise app accessibility and user reach.

**Next Steps:**
   - Proceed with app development using the chosen technology stack, prioritising the implementation of core features identified in the features breakdown.
   - Continue refining mockups and flowcharts based on stakeholder feedback and emerging design trends.

**Conclusion:**
February has seen the inception of the Disposable Camera App project, with significant strides made in defining project scope, identifying key features, and laying the groundwork for app development. With a clear vision and robust foundation, the project is well-positioned for further advancement in the months ahead.
