## Project Overview

The Disposable Camera App for Events project aims to develop a user-friendly mobile application designed for capturing and sharing memorable moments at events. This app will simulate the experience of disposable cameras, limiting the number of photos users can take and allowing participation without downloading the app.

## Project Objectives

1. Develop a mobile application compatible with both iOS and Android platforms.
2. Create an intuitive and customizable camera interface for users.
3. Implement a gallery feature for users to view and share captured moments.
4. Enable participation without app download through QR code scanning or link tapping.
5. Generate shareable QR codes and links for easy event access.
6. Enhance user experiences at events by providing a unique perspective through the app.
