      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Disposable was born from a simple idea: to simplify event photo sharing in a temporary, secure way. I, Clémentine Curel, noticed that managing permanent event photos was cumbersome and intrusive. Disposable allows users to capture and share moments instantly while ensuring that the photos remain ephemeral.
      </p>
      <p>
        What began as a personal project during my computer science studies has grown into a platform designed to empower people to create and join events effortlessly, sharing memories without the clutter of permanent storage.
